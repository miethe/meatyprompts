# Sidebar Layout

The sidebar displays primary navigation links and a prominent **New Prompt** button at the bottom. The button features a rounded background, a centered "+" icon, and the label placed beneath the icon for clarity. Its colors adapt to the active theme to remain consistent with the application's design system.
