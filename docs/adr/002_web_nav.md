# 2. Web Navigation

Date: 2025-08-05

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to create a web application with a clear and intuitive navigation structure. The application will have a dashboard, a page for managing prompts, and a way to create new prompts.

## Decision

We will use a responsive sidebar for navigation and a modal wizard for creating new prompts. The sidebar will be collapsible to save space on smaller screens.

## Consequences

This decision will result in a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate. The responsive design will ensure that the application is usable on a variety of devices. The modal wizard will provide a focused and streamlined experience for creating new prompts.
