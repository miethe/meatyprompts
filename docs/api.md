### Response

```json
{
  "items": [ { /* Prompt */ } ],
  "next_cursor": "opaque-string-or-null",
  "count": 37,
  "total_estimate": null
}
```

The `next_cursor` value should be sent in the `after` query parameter to
retrieve the next page.  The cursor format is opaque and may change over
time.

## GET /_int/tenancy/ping

Internal endpoint that returns the current tenant identifier from the session
context. It is intended for development and testing of tenancy features.

Optional query parameter `include=count` adds a `count` field with the
number of prompts in each collection.

### POST /collections

Create a collection by providing a JSON body `{ "name": "Project" }`.
Returns the created collection. Duplicate names for the same user result
in `409`.

### PATCH /collections/{collection_id}

collection.

### DELETE /collections/{collection_id}

Remove a collection and its prompt memberships. Responds with `204` on
success.

### POST /collections/{collection_id}/prompts

Add a prompt to a collection with body `{ "prompt_id": "uuid" }`.
Operation is idempotent and returns `{ "ok": true }`.

### DELETE /collections/{collection_id}/prompts/{prompt_id}

membership does not exist.
