# Prompt Detail Modal

The Prompt Detail modal presents all fields of a prompt in a compact view. By default, fields render in a read-only state using the same editors as the manual prompt form. Selecting **Edit** toggles the modal into an editable state and enables CodeMirror-powered editors for the body, sample input and sample output fields. A copy button next to the body allows quick access to the prompt text.
