# Vault View

The Prompts page renders a responsive grid of prompt cards. Cards display the prompt title, the first line of the body, up to four tags, and a version badge. Each card includes a copy button that copies the full prompt body and displays a confirmation toast.

Filters for model, tool, and purpose are available via the Filters drawer. Applying filters reloads the prompt list, while the Clear button resets them.

When no prompts match the current filters an empty state is shown with a call-to-action button to create a new prompt.
